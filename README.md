# Chatbot Using NLP with Streamlit

This project demonstrates the implementation of a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Streamlit for building an interactive web-based user interface. The chatbot is powered by various NLP techniques, allowing users to engage in meaningful conversations.

## Features

- **Interactive Chatbot Interface**: Built using Streamlit, offering a smooth, real-time conversational experience.
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Implements NLP algorithms to process and respond intelligently to user inputs.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable with new features and responses.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple and intuitive UI for a seamless experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for the project.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for creating the interactive web-based UI.
- **NLP Libraries**: 
  - `spaCy` (or any other NLP library you prefer) for processing and understanding text.
  - `transformers` or any other pre-trained models for sophisticated NLP tasks.
- **Other Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` (if data handling is involved).
  - `scikit-learn` (for machine learning tasks like intent classification or text processing).

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatbot-nlp-streamlit.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd chatbot-nlp-streamlit
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run chatbot.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

3. Start interacting with the chatbot through the UI!
